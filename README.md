Python Code for Feature Selection in JH Yang, Cell 2019

Jason H. Yang Lab @ Rutgers New Jersey Medical School

Author: Jason Yang

This Python script performs feature selection on metabolic flux simulations associated with changes in antibiotic lethality from a biochemical screen:

* Yang_Cell2019_IC50s_log2 contains log2 transformed IC50s for ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, or gentamicin in E coli MG1655 cells grown in MOPS minimal medium supplemented with metabolites from Biolog Bacterial Phenotype Microarray plates

* Yang_Cell2019_Sims contains PFBA flux calculations for each of these screening conditions on the iJO1366 E. coli genome-scale metabolic model.

* Yang_Cell2019_Subsystems contains iJO1366 subsystems associated with each metabolic reaction.
